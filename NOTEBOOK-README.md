## Notebook setting (home/research)

âœ¨ Quick guide to add cover images

1. Once a new article is created on medium, retrieve its "guid". Example, for the article https://colabobio.medium.com/travel-healthy-a-mobile-app-for-international-travelers-to-enable-participatory-surveillance-of-cf2148ecd6e2, the guid would be the last segment of the URL: cf2148ecd6e2.

2. Copy any of the folders from the "/content/notebook/" directory. The name the directory can bey anything. But it makes sense to make it something related to the post title. Example: "/content/notebook/travel".

3. Then edit the "index.md" file from the folder just created, and set the "guid" to the medium article guid mentioned above. Host an image somewhere (imgur.com would work) and set the "bg" to the image url.
