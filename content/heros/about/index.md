description: Welcome to the Colubri Lab (CoLabo) at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. Our interdisciplinary team of computational scientists, software engineers, and visual designers is dedicated to pioneering new methods and tools for infectious disease research. We operate at the intersection of technology, data science, and public health, developing innovative solutions to understand and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. By combining novel data collection methodologies—from participatory surveillance apps to experimental epidemic games—with advanced AI/ML models and human-centered, statistically sound data visualizations, we aim to translate complex biomedical data into actionable insights. Our collaborative approach, bridging diverse fields of expertise, allows us to tackle multifaceted challenges in epidemiology and create tools that have a real-world impact on global health.
