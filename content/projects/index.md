    title: 'Epigames'
    content: 'Epigames: This is new mobile applicaitn that tries to find an answer to this question: what if playing a game on your phone could help scientists understand how diseases spread—and even prevent the next pandemic? Developed with the Epidemica platform for experimental epidemiology, this project offers the closest proxy for observing pathogen transmission in human populations'

    title: 'Travel Healthy'
    content: 'An app for monitoring infectious disease symptoms among international travelers (and more). The goal of this study is simply to map symptoms of U.S. travelers as they visit other countries, and collect samples (nasal swab, stool, blood) when they return. The really ambitious goal is to integrate the data from the app with other sources (e.g.: molecular testing) to create an outbreak forecasting system based on travel patterns.'

    title: 'SciViewer'
    content: 'Our project utilizes Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq), a cost-effective and high-throughput method, to analyze gene expression across individual cells. This technology enables us to investigate diverse biological questions such as cell type identification, cellular heterogeneity, and gene expression variability. With scRNA-seq datasets growing in size and new experimental techniques emerging rapidly, our research aims to leverage these advancements for deeper insights into complex biological systems.'

    title: 'VR Cellular Experience'
    content: 'Virtual Outbreak was developed to excite students to ask questions and interact in ways you can only experience in a virtual 3D space/environment. Make that space tie directly to what is being taught and let the space itself be an extension of the classroom subject matter and curriculum. By placing students and other participants into, in this first example, a cell with surrounding cellular structures Colubri can encourage people to engage with the environment around them in a way that reinforces the subject matter being taught.'

    title: 'Muttomics'
    content: 'Are stereotypes about dog personalities really true? Scientists from the Darwin’s Dogs project at Harvard, Broad Institute have found, looking at the dogs’ behavior survey data, that variation within each breed is very broad and so those behavioral stereotypes are far less pronounced than people typically think. Muttomics was developed as a visualization tool to describe the statistical linkage between dog breeds and their behaviors and physical traits in a more visual way. Users can explore the probability of matching a dog breed with particular behavior features or physical traits they may be interested in.'
