I am student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computational Linguistics & Biomedical Engineering. As an intern at UMass Chan Medical School, I work on Bluetooth-based proximity sensing and its applications in healthcare research. With a strong interest in artificial intelligence, I am eager to explore how emerging technologies can support medical innovation and improve patient care. Outside of research, I enjoy learning about new AI developments and experimenting with creative projects.
